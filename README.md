This Python-based Alumni Management System is designed to help institutions manage and organize their alumni data effectively. The system allows for alumni registration, career tracking, and providing updates on events or job opportunities. It operates through a simple command-line interface without a graphical user interface (GUI). The project does not use a database; instead, data is stored locally in files like CSV or JSON. To set up, ensure Python is installed, download the project files, and run the main script. This tool aims to maintain strong connections between institutions and their alumni community.
